"""Airflow 3 Assets shared by the Dags.

Assets replace Airflow 2's Datasets and are how the Dags in this tutorial are
wired together: the DataOps Dag *produces* `labeled_projects`, and the MLOps Dag
is scheduled on it (`schedule=[LABELED_PROJECTS]`) instead of guessing a cron
that runs "some time after" DataOps finishes.

An Asset is identified by a name and a URI. Here the assets are name-only, which
keeps them identical whether you run in Docker or natively; in production give
them the real URI of the data (`s3://...`, `bq://...`) so lineage in the UI
points somewhere.
